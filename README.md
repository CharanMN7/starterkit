## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended: 20+)
- npm or yarn or pnpm

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devsForFun/frontend-template.git
cd frontend-template
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Set up environment variables

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

2. Update the environment variables in `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Or, you can create a project directly on GitHub by choosing `devsForFun/frontend-template` as the template.

## Authentication System

The template includes a secure authentication system with several security enhancements:

### Features

- Email/password authentication
- Google OAuth integration
- Strong password requirements
- Secure password handling
- Session management with secure cookies
- Protection against common attack vectors

### Rate Limiting

To protect against brute force attacks and abuse, the system implements rate limiting:

- **Login**: Limited to 5 attempts per minute per email
- **Registration**: Limited to 3 attempts per minute per email
- Automatic blocking of excessive login/registration attempts
- Graceful error messages that don't reveal sensitive information

### Security Headers

The application implements various security headers through middleware:

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

### Limitations

- The current rate limiting implementation uses in-memory storage, which doesn't persist between server restarts
- For production environments, consider replacing with a Redis-based solution
- IP-based limiting should be added for additional security
